It is an simple implementation of simple client server chat system where once client are connected to server,
then they can communicate with each other.

The client first needs to connect with the server and can then issue two commands -
  1. GET - This command fetches the list of client's that are currently connected to server.
  2. SEND (client number) (message) - SEND followed by client number which can be be used to send the meassage
                                      to particular to that particular client number.
                                      (please issue the complete send command in one go).
                            
To run these program first run ChatServer.c and then run multiple instatnces of ChatServer.c .

Currently these programs works on same machine.
